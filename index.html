<h1>Australian Fossil Record</h1>
	<div id="row1"> 
	<h2>History of Life</h2>
	<text1>
	<p>Life on earth has existed for hundreds of millions of years in many different forms, but the vast majority of species that have existed have gone extinct and will never be seen again.</p>
	<p>Fossils are our window into these lost worlds, and the fossil record includes thousands of these species spanning millions of years in Australia alone. When these ancient animals died, they were encased in rock, clay, or sediment and their shape and form remain preserved to this day. Access to these rocks allows us to uncover these fossils and recreate what these creatures might have looked like, and there are fossil rich sites all around the country.</p>
	<p>Because life on earth has existed so long and in so many forms, the ~540 million years since complex life started evolving is split into 3 eras: the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic. The boundaries between eras are set at periods of massive ecological upheaval that causes mass extinctions, leaving niches for new animals to fill, and changing the face of life on the planet. </p>
	<p>One way to work out the era to which the fossils belonged, is by working out the age of the rocky deposit the fossil is found in. The many fossil-rich deposits around Australia vary greatly in age, and as such have provided us a good picture of life on this land through the eras. </p>

		<h2>Phyla Throughout the Periods</h2>
			<text2>
			<p>Within each era, there are also a number of periods that represent smaller, but not necessarily any less distinct, periods of time. The Cambrian period is the first period in the Paleozioc era and represents the start of what we think of as complex life. </p>
			<p>The Mesozoic era, which is sometimes known as the Age of the Dinosaurs, spans the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. The Mesozoic era began around 252 million years ago and ended with the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. This means that the dinosaurs roamed the earth for longer than  they have been extinct.</p>
			<p>The current period is known as the Quaternary period, and represents the time that species recognisable as humans have existed on the planet. This period has lasted 2.6 million years, an eyeblink in geological time, putting into context just how little of our planetâ€™s history our species has been around to witness.</p>
			</text2>

		<text3>
			<p>The many different kinds of animals that have existed on this planet are split into groups called phyla. Each phylum represents a large group of species with shared characteristics. While there are many phyla represented in  the fossil record, some of the most interesting and successful are the Arthropods, the Molluscs, and the Chordates.</p>
			<p>The Arthropods, or Arthropoda, are the largest invertebrate phylum and are made up of insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and many other kinds of animals with exoskeletons and numerous legs. Arthropods have been a successful group since they emerged and remain one of the most numerous animals on the planet even today. The arthropods were the first animals to make the move from water to land, one of the most important evolutionary leaps in our planets ecological history.</p>
			<p>The Molluscs, or Mollusca, are the second largest invertebrate phylum and include clams, mussels, snails, slugs, and other soft bodied animals, often with hard protective shells. Molluscs have also been a very successful lineage, however they are not as ubiquitous on land as the arthropods.</p>
			<p>The Chordates, or Chordata, is the animal phylum that most people would be most familiar with, but possibly not by name. Chordata includes all vertebrate animals such as mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Chordates may be some of the most prominent and popular animals in the fossil record but have not always been the dominant phylum.</p>
