<h1>Australian Fossil Record</h1>
	<div id="row1"> 
	<h2>History of Life</h2>
	<text1>
	<p>Life on earth has existed for hundreds of millions of years in many different forms, but the vast majority of species that have existed have gone extinct and will never be seen again.</p>
	<p>Fossils are our window into these lost worlds, and the fossil record includes thousands of these species spanning millions of years in Australia alone. When these ancient animals died, they were encased in rock, clay, or sediment and their shape and form remain preserved to this day. Access to these rocks allows us to uncover these fossils and recreate what these creatures might have looked like, and there are fossil rich sites all around the country.</p>
	<p>Because life on earth has existed so long and in so many forms, the ~540 million years since complex life started evolving is split into 3 eras: the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic. The boundaries between eras are set at periods of massive ecological upheaval that causes mass extinctions, leaving niches for new animals to fill, and changing the face of life on the planet. </p>
	<p>One way to work out the era to which the fossils belonged, is by working out the age of the rocky deposit the fossil is found in. The many fossil-rich deposits around Australia vary greatly in age, and as such have provided us a good picture of life on this land through the eras. </p>

		<h2>Phyla Throughout the Periods</h2>
			<text2>
			<p>Within each era, there are also a number of periods that represent smaller, but not necessarily any less distinct, periods of time. The Cambrian period is the first period in the Paleozioc era and represents the start of what we think of as complex life. </p>
			<p>The Mesozoic era, which is sometimes known as the Age of the Dinosaurs, spans the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. The Mesozoic era began around 252 million years ago and ended with the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. This means that the dinosaurs roamed the earth for longer than  they have been extinct.</p>
			<p>The current period is known as the Quaternary period, and represents the time that species recognisable as humans have existed on the planet. This period has lasted 2.6 million years, an eyeblink in geological time, putting into context just how little of our planetâ€™s history our species has been around to witness.</p>
			</text2>
			<div id="phylum_lines"></div>
		<text3>
			<p>The different kinds of animals are split into phyla. Each phylum represents a group of species with shared characteristics. While there are many phyla represented in the fossil record, some of the most interesting and successful are the Arthropods, the Molluscs, and the Chordates.</p>
			<p>The Arthropods are the largest invertebrate phylum and are made up of insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and many other kinds of animals with exoskeletons and numerous legs. Molluscs are the second largest and comprise many soft bodied animals, such as snails and clams. Arthropods were the first to make the jump from water to land and remain one of the most numerous animals on the planet even today.</p>
			<p>The Chordates are the phylum that people find most recognisable. Chordata includes all vertebrate animals such as mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Chordates are the most prominent and popular animals in the fossil record but have not always been the dominant phylum.</p>

		<h2>How complete is this picture?</h2>
			<text2>
			<p>While the fossil record does give us a window into the past, it is certainly not a complete picture. Only a fraction of animals that die are fossilised, and this can be skewed by how easy different features are to fossilise. Hard body parts, like exoskeleton or bone, are much more likely to be preserved than soft body parts, so animals like jellyfish will turn up as fossils far lass than insects with their exoskeletons, or dinosaurs with their bones. </p>
			<p>The size of animals is also a consideration, with larger animals, although generally being less numerous in life, being much more likely to fossilise and be found as fossils than small animals.</p>
			<p>Our techniques for finding fossils, as well as the fossil-bearing rock available to us can also play a large role in what small section of biological history we get a window to through fossils.</p>

		<p>Our picture of the history of life is nowhere close to being complete, but what we do know paints a vibrant and diverse image of the vast history of this planet. As we fill in the gaps, we learn more about our planet, our land, and our own history.</p>
